# Solubility Prediction Model

This project demonstrates how to load and process the Delaney Solubility dataset using `pandas`. The dataset contains chemical descriptors and their corresponding solubility values, which can be used to predict the solubility of a compound.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the **Delaney Solubility Dataset**, which is available from the Data Professor's GitHub repository. The dataset contains the following columns:

- **logS**: The solubility value of the compound in logarithmic scale.
- Various chemical descriptors that represent different properties of the compounds.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- sklearn : For data splitting and prediction.
- matplotlib : For plotting the prediction graph.
  
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
